# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application implemented in TypeScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

2. **Install TypeScript**: If you haven't installed TypeScript globally, you can do so using the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
   ```

4. **Navigate to the project directory**: Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd todo-list-app
   ```

5. **Compile TypeScript**: Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):

   ```
   tsc app.ts
   ```

6. **Run the application**: Execute the generated JavaScript code using Node.js:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage

1. **Add a Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

2. **Complete a Task**: Click on a task in the list to mark it as completed.

3. **Delete a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
